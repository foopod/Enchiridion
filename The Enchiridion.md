Every event or action is either within or outside of our control. If you place too much dependence on the things outside your control then you will surely be disappointed. Thus instead of reacting in an upset manner when something doesn't go your way because you had no control, then try to explain it to yourself as such. We must be willing to let these things go, the impact on our lives if we don't is often not worth the pain.

However I do believe that this should be taken with a grain of salt, some Stoics take this idea too far, to the point where they believe that all negative emotions can only affect you in a negative way. 
Reading a translation of the Enchiridion of Epictetus ...

>"If, for example, you are fond of a specific ceramic cup, remind yourself that it is only ceramic cups in general of which you are fond. Then, if it breaks, you will not be disturbed. If you kiss your child, or your wife, say that you only kiss things which are human, and thus you will not be disturbed if either of them dies." - [Elizabeth Carter][Carter].

Alarmingly this suggests that it is better to be devoid of emotion in this situation, and while strong emotions that stem from grieving definitely have negative effects, I believe that they can impact us positively as well. Not only are these feelings good for the healing process and creating closure, but it is these experiences that fuel your own compassion and ability to empathise with others.

I am not a Stoic...
>"Despite the popular image, the Stoic does not repress or deny his emotions; instead he simply doesnâ€™t have them in the first place" - [John Sellars][Sellars].

It is right to be passionless. Emotions are part of human nature, they are instinctive. One should not seek to become unemotional, one should not try to repress or control their emotions, one should simply try to better understand them and how they affect their thoughts and actions.

Any goal is achievable if you put everything you have into it's attainment. The Stoics believed that if you fail to attain your desires you would only be left with pain, but should we fear the pain of failure? If we define failure as the inability to achieve a goal in a period of time, this means that in our own minds we are inadequate to what we hoped to be, such is defeat. In terms of evolution, this instinctive pain we associate with failure may have been a means of self-preservation, thus avoiding situations where the outcome was unknown and could result in loss of life or a potential mate. The emotional pain we experience is a deterrent, but how is this deterrent meant to be used? Either we look at it in such a way that we should try harder to achieve our goals, or avoid trying all together.

In the last 5000 years our society has drastically changed in such a way that evolution has not been able to keep up and we ourselves have impeded the process of natural selection. There are a number of vestigial traits in humans that Charles Darwin listed in "The Descent of Man", I suggest that some of the instinctive emotions we have may now be a hindrance rather than an advantage. Failure is not synonymous with death as it has been in the past, we now need to look to failure as a learning tool and the pain simply as a motivating factor to do better next time.

and that we should only attempt to attain the things that are solely under our own of realm of influence. is it morally right for one to solely focus on achieving their own desires? 

Should we fear the pain of failure?

While following this belief, without a passion to fulfill your desires how can one expect to achieve anything of greatness? Epictetus does alude and someone warn of this however...
"Remember that following desire promises the attainment of that of which you are desirous; and aversion promises the avoiding that to which you are averse."

So, is it morally right for one to solely focus on achieving their own desires? This is controversial, Stoicism focuses on virtue, can one be entirely selfless?
