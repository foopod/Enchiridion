Every event or action is either within or outside of our control. If you place too much dependence on the things outside your control then you will surely be disappointed. Thus instead of reacting in an upset manner when something doesn't go your way because you had no control, then try to explain it to yourself as such. We must be willing to let these things go, the impact on our lives if we don't is often not worth the pain.

However I do believe that this should be taken with a grain of salt, some Stoics take this idea too far, to the point where they believe that all negative emotions can only affect you in a negative way. 
Reading a translation of the Enchiridion of Epictetus ...

>"If, for example, you are fond of a specific ceramic cup, remind yourself that it is only ceramic cups in general of which you are fond. Then, if it breaks, you will not be disturbed. If you kiss your child, or your wife, say that you only kiss things which are human, and thus you will not be disturbed if either of them dies." - [Elizabeth Carter][Carter].

Alarmingly this suggests that it is better to be devoid of emotion in this situation, and while strong emotions that stem from grieving definitely have negative effects, I believe that they can impact us positively as well. Not only are these feelings good for the healing process and creating closure, but it is these experiences that fuel your own compassion and ability to empathise with others.

I am not a Stoic...
>"Despite the popular image, the Stoic does not repress or deny his emotions; instead he simply doesn’t have them in the first place" - [John Sellars][Sellars].

It is not right to be passionless. Emotions are part of human nature, they are instinctive. One should not seek to become unemotional, one should not try to repress or control their emotions, one should simply try to better understand them and how they affect their thoughts and actions.

Any goal is achievable if you put everything you have into it's attainment. The Stoics believed that if you fail to attain your desires you would only be left with pain, but should we fear the pain of failure? If we define failure as the inability to achieve a goal, in our own minds we see ouselves as inadequate or weak. In terms of evolution, this instinctive pain we associate with failure may have been a means of self-preservation, thus avoiding situations where the outcome was unknown and could result in loss of life or a potential mate. If we look at this emotional pain we experience as a deterrent, how should we use it? Either we should try harder to achieve our goals in the future, or perhaps avoid trying all together.

Is it morally right for one to focus on achieving their own desires? This is controversial, Stoicism focuses on leading a virtuous life, but to what extent? Should one first help themselves before they help others? What if fulfilling your desires increases your potential to fulfill the desires of others? 

A Stoic also believes that we should only attempt to attain the things that are solely under our own of realm of influence and we should do this "lightly, and with gentleness and reservation". This is partially true as it is important to set achieveable goals, especially ones that don't rely heavily on external factors. This is a very common way people are taught from a young age; to make their goals clear, measureable and achieveable. However being conservative when you set goals will only hold you back, it is just as important to challenge yourself.

Anything is achievable if you put your mind to it.

>“Enthusiasm is one of the most powerful engines of success. When you do a thing, do it with all your might. Put your whole soul into it. Stamp it with your own personality. Be active, be energetic, be enthusiastic and faithful, and you will accomplish your object. Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.” - [Ralph Waldo Emerson][Emerson]
