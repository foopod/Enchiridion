# [The Enchiridion][enchiridion]

Lately I have been exploring the idea of stoicism, it focuses on using logical reasoning to better manage emotions and emphasizes ethics as the main focus of human knowledge. I have decided to not only read but rewrite passages from the stoic text, the Enchiridion. What comes out is not going to be anything like what went in, I am not a Stoic, nor do I seek to be one, but I do see an opportunity for learning from their ideals.
